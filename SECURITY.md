## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please note that **Muzykant Music** is currently in **ALPHA** stage, and we **do not guarantee** that the software is secure or stable. However, if you discover any vulnerabilities, please report them to us via the designated channels (e.g., GitHub Issues).

You can expect updates on reported vulnerabilities, but please understand that, as the project is still under heavy development, responses might take longer than usual.

If a vulnerability is accepted, we will work to address it in future updates. If it is declined, you will be informed with a brief explanation.

**Important**: Since the software is still in **ALPHA**, **we cannot guarantee that it is secure or stable**, and **we are not responsible for any damages** that may occur while using it.
